The real bottleneck to AI progress may be the aging electrical grid. Constraints are starting to emerge as new data centers are coming online and demanding more electricity.

Data centers are power-hungry machines. The US currently has approximately 25 GW of data centers in operation. At the end of 2024, 92 GW of data center projects were being developed, which could mean that by 2030 the US will have 100 GW or more in operation.

| Data center capacity is measured by the maximum electrical load they can draw from the grid. This is not ongoing consumption, rather the *power capacity.*

**Data center capacity could quadruple by 2030.** In the US, data centers currently account for 4.4% of total electricity use. In the next five years, data centers could consume close to 16% of the total electricity supply in the US.

Supporting this growth will be challenging for the US electrical grid. The current grid consists of aging infrastructure - most of the power lines are over 25 years old, and many of the transformers and power supply units are over 40 years old. How did we get here and what can we do to improve the grid?

## Producers

The electric grid is a marketplace which connects **producers** of energy with **consumers**. On the supply side, utilities own power plants which generate electricity. Power plants use a combination of different resources to generate power including **fossil fuels** (gas, coal), **nonrenewables** (nuclear) and **renewables** (wind, solar, hydro).

This is current fuel mix in the US and China:

To meet the growing electricity demand, both countries need to invest into more generation. It's interesting to note both the US and China are producing around 60% of electricity from fossil fuels. There are slightly different dynamics at play in each country.

Until recently, US electricity demand had remained relatively stagnant. In 2023, wind and solar finally generated more electricity than coal. Older coal power plants are gradually being retired and replaced by new wind and and solar generation.

### China

China, on the other hand, has been dealing with a growing electricity demand from a growing manufacturing and industrial base. China is investing heavily into renewables - they have the largest solar and wind projects in the world. Each year China brings online more power than Germany's entire capacity.

Centralized planning in this case benefits Chinese industry and electric supply. China has a significant surplus of energy supply, and needs to find ways to use this surplus. Data centers are perfect for this use case - they can be used to consume some of the surplus power. China has also invested in high voltage transmission lines. This infrastructure is new.

### Nuclear

So how can the US increase our power supply? Nuclear is an attractive option because of the energy density. There have been quite a few investments in small modular reactors and other nuclear companies (including a high profile investment by Bill Gates). Could nuclear fill the gap?

The US nuclear production is projected to remain flat for the next 5 years. There are some new plants being built, and some old ones decomissioned, which balance out to a steady state.

Historically, nuclear has been underinvested because of public opinion. After Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukashima, the public opinion of nuclear was that it was unsafe. It's worth reading about both of these incidents in more detail because safety has improved dramatically. These were also incidents which for separate reasons are completely avoidable.

Electricity demand from data centers has already started to push regulators to open new nuclear facilities. Microsoft has pushed to reopen Three Mile Island, which has been closed for 30 years since there was a nuclear meltdown. This project is in development and projected to open in YYYY.

However, there is a fundamental bottleneck in the development of nuclear. Most nuclear facilities use Low Enriched Uranium (LUE) which is 4-5%. This fuel can be produced in X PLACE. However there is a more efficient fuel, HALEU (High Assay Low Enriched Uranium). This fuel is advantageous because it allows the reactors to operate more efficiently.

The only site for enriching HALEU is located in Russia. For geopolitical reasons, we don't have access to any supply of HALEU for the foreseeable future. The US DOE is investing in domestic HALEU enrichment sites, but they won't be completed until 2030 or later.

For the next 5 years we are going to be dealing with the current fuel mix, and nuclear likely will continue to contribute a steady state to the energy mix.

### UK

The UK has an abundance of renewables, and is actually located close to some of the best wind energy sites. However the disadvantage of renewables is that they cannot generate power on demand, and there is a significant portion of the day when they are not generating power. Most obviously, at night solar does not generate any energy.

This causes the electric grid to switch to gas, which is a dirtier fuel mix and generates more carbon dioxide, as well as being more expensive. This impacts the end customer - they pay more for power and suffer the disadvantages of a dirtier power.

## Consumers

Consumers can be both commercial and residential. The breakdown of energy consumption between commercial and residential is shown below. Commercial power is highly industry dependent - data centers will have a different load curve than a steel manufacturing plant.

Residential consumers can be modeled as very similar to each other. In aggregate the consumption patterns of residential consumers are similar to each other, they might only differ by orders of magnitude. Residential consumers wake up in the morning, start consuming power, then leave for work, and eventually return home and consume the most power in the evening before they go to sleep (cooking, cleaning, laundry).

The problem is that the gap in renewables often coincides with when residential consumers are consuming the most power. When customers return home, there is more demand and less supply, which causes prices to rise.

## Suppliers

Now we have producers and consumers, how does energy get between the two? For the most part, energy production is privatized in the US and the UK. However, the entity that transmits power from the producer to the consumer is regulated by the state. There are a couple of reasons for this.

During industrialization, the state had an interest in ensuring that the entire population was able to receive power. There are many rural areas which do not result in much revenue, but need access to electricity. The state therefore gave a company a monopoly with the condition that it built the electric grid to connect all communities, including rural communities with small populations. This is similar to the monopoly which the US gave to Bell Labs when it was first laying the telephone wires.

Suppliers sell electricity to consumers, both residential, commercial and industrial. Suppliers therefore have to buy wholesale electricity from generators, and sell retail electricity to consumers. Suppliers aggregate consumer demand and pass it to the wholesale market.

Electricity markets are interesting because traditionally there is no way to store electricity. This is because all of the trading volume must clear, exactly, at every single time during the day. Supply and demand must balance at each instant in time. The total amount of electricity offered by generators must exactly match the amount demanded by consumers.

This is not just to protect the interest of consumers. The electric grid will degrade if there is an oversupply or undersupply. During periods of oversupply, the frequency of AC current can rise above 50/60 Hz which can damage the billions of dollars of electrical equipment. Undersupply can sag the power frequency which can also damage equipment.

To clear the balance of power, most markets try to anticipate demand a day in advance at every interval during the day. Most countries use hourly intervals, the UK being the special country it is, uses half-hourly intervals. One day in advance, suppliers publish demand forecast for their customer base. This is cross-referenced by the system operators who own the transmission lines and the grid infrastructure itself. This was the state-regulated entity we discussed earlier.

Market exchanges then collect all demand forecasts and generator bids, and match them to set the market clearing price. The market exchange then plans how much power the generators are going to produce, and how much electricity the suppliers will distribute to their consumers. This is another strange aspect of electricity markets - once the bids clear, the generators are on the hook to produce exactly that much electricity, otherwise the grid itself will destabilize. The same goes for the suppliers - if their demand forecast is off, the grid will destabilize.

Forecasts are not always correct, of course, so during the day the transmission system operator steps in to fill the gaps between demand and supply. The TSO has a set of dispatchable resources (mostly gas, coal and nuclear) which they can spin up to meet the power of the grid on demand.

As you can see, the electricity market is a very unique market where demand and supply need to meet exactly, otherwise the physical system will destabilize.

## Demand Response

There are two levers to balance the grid - adjust supply, or adjust demand. Energy suppliers often won’t have the ability to generate more power, but they can reduce demand. There are a few ways of doing this.

The first is by incentivizing their customer base to switch their consumption patterns using tariffs. Utilities will often use on-peak / off-peak pricing to incentivize consumers to move their consumption to periods of low use. This has a couple of effects on the system:

Power is cheaper during these times, so the supplier and the consumer can both save money by using electricity when it is cheaper.
Fuel mix can be cleaner during these times. This means there is less carbon emissions and we can avoid emitting CO2.

When modeling these systems, you would take a rate by the utility and apply some sort of demand response function which models how the consumers respond to the rates. Of course there are more functions that go into demand response programs than simply adjusting pricing - as with all products, marketing plays a big role as well to make customers aware.

The second type of demand response is physical control, where the supplier or an aggregator will manually intervene to adjust consumer’s consumption habits. This is a lot less intrusive than it might sound at first, if you consider the distributed energy resources in the grid.
