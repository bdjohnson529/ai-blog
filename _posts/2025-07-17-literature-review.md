HELLO WORLD 

This article is a literature review of LLM research between 2017-2025. The reader should be familiar with basic coding concepts, but does not need detailed knowledge of neural networks.

After reading this guide you should understand:

1. Why LLMs have become increasingly powerful in the last 3 years
2. What are the current research frontiers for LLMs

This article focuses on algorithmic research, but does not cover hardware innovations. LLM research has been made possible by access to large-scale compute, so itâ€™s worth noting that hardware advancements are equally critical but will not be addressed in this guide.
