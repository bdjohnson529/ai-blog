## About Me

Hello! My name is Ben Johnson and this is my blog. Born in Denver, studied physics at USC, and now living in London.

Physics is taught from first principles. You begin by learning foundational laws which serve as the basis for all problem solving. One of the best physicists to demonstrate this approach is Richard Feynman - I'd recommend reading **Six Easy Pieces** to understand his approach to problem solving.

Understanding the foundations is powerful. This blog focuses on Applied AI, but will also discuss foundational AI research. My hope is that these articles will help engineers and product folks better understand the capabilities of the models, and help researchers better understand applications.
